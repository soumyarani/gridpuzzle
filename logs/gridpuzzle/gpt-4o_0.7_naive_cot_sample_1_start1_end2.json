            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 2, we know that Galen scored 62%.\n   ```\n   55% |                    |  \n   62% | Galen              | \n   69% |                    | \n   76% |                    | \n   ```\n\n2. From clue 4, we know that Proclus scored 76%.\n   ```\n   55% |                    |  \n   62% | Galen              | \n   69% |                    | \n   76% | Proclus            | \n   ```\n\n3. From clue 3, the A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford. Since Proclus scored 76%, the system from Oxford scored 76%.\n   ```\n   55% |                    |  \n   62% | Galen              | \n   69% |                    | \n   76% | Proclus            | Oxford\n   ```\n\n4. From clue 1, Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA. This means:\n   - UCLA scored 69%, and Zeno scored 76%. However, since 76% is already assigned to Proclus, Zeno must have scored 69%.\n   - This means UCLA scored 62%, and since 62% is already assigned to Galen, UCLA must be associated with Galen.\n   ```\n   55% |                    |  \n   62% | Galen              | UCLA\n   69% | Zeno               | \n   76% | Proclus            | Oxford\n   ```\n\n5. From clue 5, the system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno. Since Zeno scored 69%, the system from CIT must have scored 55%.\n   ```\n   55% |                    | CIT\n   62% | Galen              | UCLA\n   69% | Zeno               | \n   76% | Proclus            | Oxford\n   ```\n\n6. The only remaining A.I. is Archimedes, who must have scored 55%.\n   ```\n   55% | Archimedes         | CIT\n   62% | Galen              | UCLA\n   69% | Zeno               | \n   76% | Proclus            | Oxford\n   ```\n\n7. The only remaining institution is Exeter, which must be associated with Zeno.\n   ```\n   55% | Archimedes         | CIT\n   62% | Galen              | UCLA\n   69% | Zeno               | Exeter\n   76% | Proclus            | Oxford\n   ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n55% | Archimedes | CIT\n62% | Galen      | UCLA\n69% | Zeno       | Exeter\n76% | Proclus    | Oxford\n```"
