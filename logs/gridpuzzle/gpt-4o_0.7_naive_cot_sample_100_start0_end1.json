From clues 4 and 6, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 (pinot noir), either one must be in 1984 (but 1984 is gewurztraminer), so the merlot must be Bianca Flaux.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |               | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 |               | \n   ```\n\n4. From clue 2, Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.

Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Clue 6**: The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n    - 1984 |                    | gewurztraminer\n    - 1988 |                    | \n    - 1992 |                    | \n    - 1996 |                    | \n\n2. **Clue 3**: The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n    - 1984 |                    | gewurztraminer\n    - 1988 |                    | pinot noir\n    - 1992 |                    | \n    - 1996 |                    | \n\n3. **Clue 4**: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.  \n   Since the merlot can only be Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux, we have:\n    - 1984 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | gewurztraminer\n    - 1988 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | pinot noir\n    - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n    - 1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n\n4. **Clue 5**: The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.\n   **Clue 2**: The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.\n   - From these clues, the order of the wines is: Ece Suss before Bianca Flaux, and Bianca Flaux before Vendemmia.\n   - Therefore, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n\n    - 1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | gewurztraminer\n    - 1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Bianca Flaux | pinot noir\n    - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n    - 1996 | Annata Branco or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n\n5. **Clue 1**: The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.\n   - Therefore, Ece Suss cannot be in 1984, and Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 because Ece Suss must be before it.\n\n    - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n    - 1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n    - 1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n    - 1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - The orders satisfy all the clues:\n     - Ece Suss (1988) is after Annata Branco (1984).\n     - Bianca Flaux (1992) is after Ece Suss (1988).\n     - Bianca Flaux (1992) is 4 years before Vendemmia (1996).\n     - Merlot is Bianca Flaux, satisfying clue 4.\n     - Gewurztraminer is 1984 and Pinot Noir is 1988.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n```",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | \n   - 1992 |          | \n   - 1996 |          | \n\n2. From clue 3, we know that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | pinot noir\n   - 1992 |          | \n   - 1996 |          | \n\n3. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Thus, one of these wines must be in 1992 or 1996.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n\n4. From clue 5, Bianca Flaux was bottled after Ece Suss. From clue 2, Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before Vendemmia. Thus, the order is Ece Suss, then Bianca Flaux, then Vendemmia.\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n\n5. From clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled after Annata Branco.\n   - Ece Suss cannot be in 1984, and Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n   - 1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n\n6. With clues 4 and 5, we see that Annata Branco must be in 1984 (gewurztraminer), Ece Suss in 1988 (pinot noir), Bianca Flaux in 1992 (merlot), and Vendemmia in 1996 (riesling).\n\nFinal Answer:\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia | riesling",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | \n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n2. From clue 3, we know that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | pinot noir\n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n3. Clue 4 states that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This means that the 1984 bottle cannot be merlot, so the 1984 wine must be Annata Branco or Ece Suss. \n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. Combining clues 2 and 5, the order is Ece Suss < Bianca Flaux < Vendemmia. Therefore, Ece Suss cannot be 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be 1984 or 1988.\n\n5. From step 4, since Ece Suss cannot be in 1984, Annata Branco must be the wine for 1984.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |               | pinot noir\n   1992 |               | \n   1996 |               | \n   ```\n\n6.

Since Ece Suss is in 1988, Bianca Flaux, which is bottled after Ece Suss, must be in 1992, and consequently, Vendemmia must be in 1996.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | \n   1996 | Vendemmia     | \n   ```\n\n8. From clue 4, the merlot is either Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco is already determined as gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux must be the merlot.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia     | \n   ```\n\n9. The only remaining type for 1996 (Vendemmia) is riesling.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n   ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clues 4 and 6, the only remaining types for 1992 and 1996 are merlot and riesling. Also, since the merlot is either Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux, and 1984 is gewurztraminer, 1992 or 1996 must be merlot. Therefore, either 1992 or 1996 is merlot, and the other is riesling.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | pinot noir\n   - 1992 |          | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 |          | merlot or riesling\n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means the order is Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and Vendemmia. So, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988. \n   - 1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss                   | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Bianca Flaux   | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia  | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 | Annata Branco or Vendemmia                  | merlot or riesling\n\n5.

Clue 4 tells us that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. However, we don't have enough information yet to place the merlot.\n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. Also, from clue 2, Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.

From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. We will explore these options later. \n\n4. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1996, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984. The possible pairs for Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia are (1984, 1988), (1988, 1992), or (1992, 1996).\n\n5. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. So, Ece Suss cannot be in 1996, and Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984. Based on clues 2 and 5, the order of bottling could be Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and then Vendemmia.\n\n6. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. So, Ece Suss cannot be in 1984.\n\nCombining clues 1, 2, and 5:\n- Annata Branco must be in 1984 (since Ece Suss is after Annata Branco).\n- Ece Suss must be in 1988 (since it is after Annata Branco and before Bianca Flaux).\n- Bianca Flaux must be in 1992 (since it is 4 years before Vendemmia and after Ece Suss).\n- Vendemmia must be in 1996 (since it is after Bianca Flaux).\n\n7.

Clue 4 states that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.\n\n4. From clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled after Annata Branco.\n\n5. From clues 2 and 5, Bianca Flaux was bottled after Ece Suss and 4 years before Vendemmia. Thus, Ece Suss cannot be 1996, and Bianca Flaux cannot be 1984 or 1996. Vendemmia cannot be 1984 or 1988.\n\n6. Combine clues 1 and 5: Ece Suss must be before Bianca Flaux, which is before Vendemmia. Therefore, the order must be: Annata Branco, Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n\n7. Since 1984 is gewurztraminer, Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   ```\n\n8.

            "To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct matches for each vintage.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Clue 6**: The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   - **Table:**\n     ```\n     1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n     1988 |          | \n     1992 |          | \n     1996 |          | \n     ```\n\n2. **Clue 3**: The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n   - **Table:**\n     ```\n     1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n     1988 |          | pinot noir\n     1992 |          | \n     1996 |          | \n     ```\n\n3. **Clue 4**: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since the gewurztraminer (1984) is not merlot, and neither can the pinot noir (1988), merlot can only be in 1992 or 1996.\n   - **Table:**\n     ```\n     1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n     1988 |          | pinot noir\n     1992 |          | merlot or riesling\n     1996 |          | merlot or riesling\n     ```\n\n4. **Clue 5**: The Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss.

This means:\n   - If Bianca Flaux is in 1988, Vendemmia would be in 1992 (not possible since 1988 is pinot noir).\n   - If Bianca Flaux is in 1992, Vendemmia would be in 1996.\n   - If Bianca Flaux is in 1996, Vendemmia cannot be bottled later (since 1996 is the last year).\n\n   Therefore, Bianca Flaux must be in 1992 and Vendemmia in 1996.\n\n6. Using step 5's findings along with clue 5, Ece Suss must be in 1988 since Bianca Flaux is in 1992 and Ece Suss must be before Bianca Flaux.\n\n7. Using the information from clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. Since Ece Suss is in 1988, Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n\n8. From clue 4 and the conclusion from step 7, since Annata Branco is in 1984, the merlot must be Bianca Flaux in 1992.\n\n9. By elimination, the 1996 bottle must be a riesling.\n\nBased on these steps, we can fill in the table as follows:\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clue 5, we know that the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, we know that the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. Using clues 2 and 5, the order of the options is Ece Suss is before Bianca Flaux, and Bianca Flaux is before Vendemmia. So, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.

From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This doesn't help us yet in determining the exact year, but it gives us options for merlot.\n\n4. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means they must be separated by a 4-year gap. This can only be satisfied if Bianca Flaux is in 1988 or 1992 and Vendemmia is in 1992 or 1996, respectively.\n\n5. From clue 5, Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss. Combining with clue 2, this means Ece Suss must be before Bianca Flaux, which is before Vendemmia.\n\n6. From clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. This helps us place Annata Branco.\n\n7. Let's start filling the table based on the clues and exclusions:\n   - Annata Branco, being before Ece Suss, must be in 1984, as 1988 is already taken.\n   - Ece Suss, being after Annata Branco and before Bianca Flaux, must be in 1988.\n   - This makes Bianca Flaux 1992, and Vendemmia 1996.\n   - Merlot can only be the Bianca Flaux since Annata Branco is already placed in 1984 as gewurztraminer.\n\n8.

From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This implies Ece Suss < Bianca Flaux < Vendemmia.\n   - Ece Suss cannot be in 1996 because there would be no room for Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia afterward.\n   - Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 and 1988 because it needs a four-year gap after Bianca Flaux.\n   - The only valid sequence is Ece Suss in 1988 or earlier, Bianca Flaux in 1992, and Vendemmia in 1996.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss    | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss                     | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux                 | \n   1996 | Vendemmia                    | \n   ```\n\n5.

Confirming with clue 4, the merlot must be Bianca Flaux because Annata Branco is in 1984 with gewurztraminer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | \n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n2. From clue 3, we know that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | pinot noir\n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n3. From clue 4, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This helps narrow down the options for the wines but doesn't fill in any specific row yet.\n\n4. From clue 1, we know that the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. This means Annata Branco cannot be in 1996, and Ece Suss cannot be in 1984.\n\n5. From clue 5, we know that the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. This means Ece Suss cannot be in 1996, and Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984.\n\n6. From clue 2, we know that the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. The only possible placements for this are:\n   - Bianca Flaux in 1988 and Vendemmia in 1992 (invalid because 1988 is pinot noir, not merlot)\n   - Bianca Flaux in 1992 and Vendemmia in 1996\n\n7. Based on the above steps:\n   - The only possible placement for Bianca Flaux is 1992, and Vendemmia is 1996.\n   - Since Bianca Flaux is in 1992, and per clue 4, it must be merlot.\n\n8. With Bianca Flaux (merlot) in 1992 and Vendemmia in 1996, we can fill in the remaining gaps:\n   - 1984 must be Annata Branco (since it can't be Ece Suss or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia).\n   - 1988 must be Ece Suss (since it can't be Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia).\n\n9. Finally, for 1996, the only remaining type is riesling, as gewurztraminer, pinot noir, and merlot are already used.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

            "Certainly! Let's solve this puzzle step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Clue 6**: The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | \n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n2. **Clue 3**: The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | pinot noir\n   1992 |          | \n   1996 |          | \n   ```\n\n3. **Clue 4**: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. We cannot determine which wine yet, but this clue will help later.\n\n4. **Clue 2 and 5**: The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia, and the Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss. Thus, the order is: Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n\n   From this, it's clear:\n   - Vendemmia cannot be 1984 or 1988 (it must be two positions after Ece Suss).\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be 1984 (since it has to be after Ece Suss).\n   \n5. **Clue 1**: The Ece Suss was bottled after the Annata Branco. This means Annata Branco cannot be in 1988 (since 1988 must be Ece Suss then).\n\n   Using these insights, our table looks like this:\n\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss               | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | \n   1996 | Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | \n   ```\n\n6. **Determining the position of Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia**: \n\n   - Since Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia, and the only options left are 1992 and 1996, Bianca Flaux must be 1992, and Vendemmia must be 1996.\n\n7. **Clue 4**: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since the Annata Branco is in 1984, which is a gewurztraminer, the merlot must be the Bianca Flaux.\n\n   Completing the table:\n\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | \n   - 1992 |          | \n   - 1996 |          | \n\n2.

From clues 2 and 5, we need to determine the order of wines. Clue 5 says Bianca Flaux is after Ece Suss, and clue 2 says Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia. This means the order is Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and then Vendemmia. Therefore, Ece Suss cannot be in 1996, and Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984.\n\n4. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled after the Annata Branco. Therefore, Annata Branco cannot be in 1988 or 1996. \n\n5. Considering clues 4, 1, and the above deductions:\n   - If Annata Branco is in 1984 (the only possibility left), then Ece Suss must be in 1988.\n   - Bianca Flaux, which is after Ece Suss, must be in 1992, and therefore Vendemmia must be in 1996.\n\n6. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco is in 1984 (gewurztraminer), Bianca Flaux must be the merlot.\n\nThe table now looks like this:\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   - 1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n\nFinal Answer:\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia | riesling",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | \n   - 1992 |          | \n   - 1996 |          | \n\n2. From clue 3, we know that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n   - 1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |          | pinot noir\n   - 1992 |          | \n   - 1996 |          | \n\n3. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This means that one of them is merlot, but we cannot determine which one yet.\n\n4. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia are separated by one of the vintages: 1984 and 1988, or 1992 and 1996.\n\n5. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. Hence, Ece Suss must be bottled before Bianca Flaux.\n\n6. Combining clues 1 and 5, we have the order:\n   - Annata Branco \u2192 Ece Suss \u2192 Bianca Flaux \u2192 Vendemmia\n\n7. Let's analyze the possible positions:\n   - 1984 cannot be Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia because Bianca Flaux is before Vendemmia.\n   - 1984 cannot be Ece Suss because Ece Suss is after Annata Branco, which would need to be in a prior year.\n   - So, 1984 must be Annata Branco.\n\n8. Placing Annata Branco in 1984:\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 |               | pinot noir\n   - 1992 |               | \n   - 1996 |               | \n\n9. Since 1984 is Annata Branco, and Bianca Flaux is not next, Bianca Flaux is not in 1988. \n\n10. From clue 1, Ece Suss is after Annata Branco, so Ece Suss must be in 1988:\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   - 1992 |               | \n   - 1996 |               | \n\n11. Now, we place Bianca Flaux in 1992 because it must be before Vendemmia:\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   - 1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n\n12. By process of elimination, Vendemmia must be in 1996, and since Annata Branco is gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux is merlot, and Vendemmia is riesling.\n\nFinal Answer:\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling",

From clues 5 and 2, we can deduce the order of wines: Ece Suss is before Bianca Flaux, and Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia. Therefore, the sequence must be Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and then Vendemmia.\n\n   Since the Vendemmia must be 4 years after Bianca Flaux, and the only valid positions are 1992 and 1996, Bianca Flaux must be in 1992 and Vendemmia in 1996.\n\n   ```\n   1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |          | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot or riesling\n   1996 | Vendemmia    | merlot or riesling\n   ```\n\n5.

From clues 2 and 5, we know Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before Vendemmia and after Ece Suss. This implies the sequence: Ece Suss < Bianca Flaux < Vendemmia.\n\n   - Therefore, Ece Suss cannot be in 1984 because Annata Branco must be earlier (clue 1). \n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984 or 1988, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984, 1988, or 1992.\n\n5.

This means:\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984.\n   - Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss                  | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Bianca Flaux  | pinot noir\n   1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | \n   1996 | Annata Branco or Vendemmia                 | \n   ```\n\n5. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. Therefore, Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.

From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This will be useful later.\n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means:\n   - Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984.\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 because it has to be after Ece Suss.\n   - Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n\n5. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled after the Annata Branco. This means:\n   - Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.\n   - Ece Suss cannot be in 1984.\n\n6.

From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux is bottled after the Ece Suss. \n   - From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux is bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. \n   - Therefore, the possible order is: Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n\n5. Using clues 1, 2, and 5:\n   - The only possible order for the wines is: Annata Branco, Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia, but we have to fit them in the correct vintages.\n   - Since Ece Suss must come after Annata Branco, and Bianca Flaux after Ece Suss, and Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia, the only possible order is:\n     - 1984: Annata Branco (must be gewurztraminer from clue 6)\n     - 1988: Ece Suss (pinot noir)\n     - 1992: Bianca Flaux (must be merlot from clue 4)\n     - 1996: Vendemmia (must be riesling since it's the only type left)\n\n6. Now, we fill in the table based on the above deductions:\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n   ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

Since Bianca Flaux is bottled before Vendemmia, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1996, so it must be either 1988 or 1992. But Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 because it must be bottled after Ece Suss. Therefore, Bianca Flaux is in 1992, and Vendemmia is in 1996.\n\n6. Since Bianca Flaux is in 1992 and Vendemmia is in 1996, Ece Suss must be in 1988 (after Annata Branco in 1984).

Since the 1988 bottle is pinot noir, it can't be merlot.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, and Vendemmia are in order: Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Bianca Flaux              | merlot or riesling\n   - 1996 | Vendemmia                 | merlot or riesling\n\n5. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. Therefore, Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.\n   - 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   - 1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   - 1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   - 1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n\n6. Check clue 4: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco is in 1984, the merlot must be the Bianca Flaux.\n\nFinal Answer:\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1.

From clues 4 and 6, we know the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Additionally, since the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer, it cannot be the merlot.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | pinot noir\n   1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n   1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Ece Suss or Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n   ```\n\n4. From clue 2, Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before Vendemmia. Therefore, Bianca Flaux can only be in 1988 or 1992, and Vendemmia can only be in 1992 or 1996. From clue 5, Bianca Flaux was bottled after Ece Suss, so Ece Suss must be before 1988.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n   ```\n\n5. From clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled sometime after Annata Branco, ruling out Ece Suss for 1984. Thus, Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n\n6. From clues 4 and 6, as Annata Branco is in 1984, the merlot must be the Bianca Flaux, which is consistent with the placement of Bianca Flaux in 1992.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n```",

From clues 4 and 5, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Also, Bianca Flaux comes after Ece Suss.\n   We don't have enough information yet to place these, so let's note possible wines:\n    ```\n    1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Vendemmia  | gewurztraminer\n    1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss or Bianca Flaux | pinot noir\n    1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia  | merlot or riesling\n    1996 | Annata Branco or Vendemmia  | merlot or riesling\n    ```\n\n4. From clue 2, we know that Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia, and from clue 5, Bianca Flaux is bottled after Ece Suss.\n    - Therefore, the sequence must be Ece Suss -> Bianca Flaux -> Vendemmia.\n    - This sequence means Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n    ```\n    1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | gewurztraminer\n    1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | pinot noir\n    1992 | Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia  | merlot or riesling\n    1996 | Vendemmia | merlot or riesling\n    ```\n\n5. From clue 1, Ece Suss is bottled after Annata Branco, and from previous deductions, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 with Ece Suss.\n    - Therefore, Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n    - Ece Suss must be in 1988.\n    ```\n    1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n    1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n    1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n    1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n    ```\n\n6. Finally, from clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco is in 1984, Bianca Flaux must be merlot.\n    ```\n    1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n    1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n    1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n    1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n    ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia | riesling\n```",

From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Thus, neither the 1984 nor the 1988 bottles can be merlot, allowing us to narrow down the options for 1992 and 1996.\n    ```\n    1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n    1988 |          | pinot noir\n    1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux | merlot or riesling\n    1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux | merlot or riesling\n    ```\n\n4. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1996, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988. Furthermore, from clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss. This means Ece Suss is not bottled in 1996. Combining clues 1 and 5, the order is Annata Branco, Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n    ```\n    1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n    1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n    1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n    1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n    ```\n\n5. Finally, we determine the wine types for each year based on the remaining clues. Clue 4 confirms that the merlot must be the Bianca Flaux, reinforcing our table.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clue 4, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This means the merlot must be in 1984 or 1992 since 1988 is pinot noir and 1996 is left for riesling.\n   ```\n   1984 |                   | gewurztraminer or merlot\n   1988 |                   | pinot noir\n   1992 |                   | merlot or riesling\n   1996 |                   | riesling\n   ```\n\n4. From clue 5, since Bianca Flaux is bottled after Ece Suss, and from clue 2, Bianca Flaux is bottled 4 years before Vendemmia, we can deduce:\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984 or 1996.\n   - Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n   - Ece Suss cannot be in 1996.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | gewurztraminer or merlot\n   1988 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux              | merlot or riesling\n   1996 | Vendemmia                 | riesling\n   ```\n\n5. From clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled after Annata Branco.

Combine clues 1, 2, and 5:\n   - Ece Suss is after Annata Branco (clue 1).\n   - Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia (clue 2).\n   - Bianca Flaux is after Ece Suss (clue 5).\n   - This implies the order: Annata Branco, Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n\n4. Using the order derived from clues 1, 2, and 5, we determine:\n   - Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n   - Ece Suss must be in 1988.\n   - Bianca Flaux must be in 1992.\n   - Vendemmia must be in 1996.\n\n5. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.\n   - Since Annata Branco is in 1984 and is a gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux must be the merlot.\n\n6. Fill in the remaining type for Vendemmia, which is riesling.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1.

From clue 4, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. We don't know yet, but this information will be useful later.\n\n4. From clues 2 and 5, we know that the order is Ece Suss, then Bianca Flaux, and finally Vendemmia. Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia. So, Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n\n5. Using clues 1 and 5, Ece Suss must be before Bianca Flaux, which makes the possible order for the wines as follows:\n   - Annata Branco\n   - Ece Suss\n   - Bianca Flaux\n   - Vendemmia\n\n   Since Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 and 1988, we have:\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco         | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss              | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux          | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia             | riesling\n   ```\n\n6. Clue 5 confirms that Bianca Flaux is after Ece Suss. Clue 4 confirms that Bianca Flaux is merlot since Annata Branco is already used in 1984.\n\n7. We have now used all the wines and types without any contradictions, confirming the solution.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Since the Annata Branco cannot be in 1988 (it would make Ece Suss before it, conflicting with clue 1), and Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1988 (conflicts with clue 5), neither can be in 1988.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss    | gewurztraminer\n   1988 |                              | pinot noir\n   1992 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | \n   1996 | Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux or Vendemmia | \n   ```\n   \n4. From clue 5, Bianca Flaux was bottled after Ece Suss. From clue 2, Bianca Flaux was 4 years before Vendemmia, so the order is Ece Suss < Bianca Flaux < Vendemmia. This rules out Bianca Flaux in 1984 and Vendemmia in 1984 and 1988.\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco or Ece Suss    | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss                     | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux                 | \n   1996 | Vendemmia                    | \n   ```\n   \n5.

From clue 4, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. Therefore, the 1984 and 1988 bottles cannot be merlot, so they cannot be Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux, respectively. We also know from clue 6 that the 1984 bottle is not a merlot.\n\n4. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Bianca Flaux cannot be 1996.\n\n5. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled after the Ece Suss. Combining clues 2 and 5, we can determine the order: Ece Suss, Bianca Flaux, Vendemmia.\n\n6. Combine clues 1 and 5: Ece Suss is after Annata Branco, and Ece Suss is before Bianca Flaux. So, Annata Branco must be in 1984.\n\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   ```\n\n7. The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

Using clue 1, Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. This means Annata Branco cannot be in 1996.\n   \n6.

Therefore, Bianca Flaux must be in 1992, and Vendemmia in 1996.\n   - From clue 4, the merlot is either Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux. Since Bianca Flaux is in 1992 and it's the only year left for merlot, it must be the merlot.\n\n5. **Fill in the remaining wines:**\n   - From the established order of wines and the clues, Ece Suss must be in 1988, after Annata Branco which has to be in 1984.\n   - This leaves Annata Branco for 1984, which aligns with the clue that 1984 is a gewurztraminer.\n   - This leaves Ece Suss to be the pinot noir in 1988.\n   - Vendemmia, the last remaining wine, is in 1996, which leaves riesling as its type.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",
            "Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Start with the given clues:**\n\n   - From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.\n     ```\n     1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n     1988 |          | \n     1992 |          | \n     1996 |          | \n     ```\n   \n   - From clue 3, we know that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.\n     ```\n     1984 |          | gewurztraminer\n     1988 |          | pinot noir\n     1992 |          | \n     1996 |          | \n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the possible wines for each vintage:**\n\n   - From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.\n   - From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.\n   - From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.\n   - From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.\n\n3. **Analyze the information:**\n\n   - Since the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia (clue 2), the only possible years for Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia are 1992 and 1996, respectively.\n   - Since the Ece Suss was bottled after the Annata Branco (clue 1) and before the Bianca Flaux (clue 5), Ece Suss cannot be in 1984 or 1992. Therefore, Annata Branco must be in 1984, and Ece Suss must be in 1988.\n   - From clue 4, the merlot is either Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux. Since Annata Branco is in 1984 and it's a gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux must be the merlot.\n\n4. **Fill in the table:**\n\n    - 1984 is Annata Branco with gewurztraminer.\n    - 1988 is Ece Suss with pinot noir.\n    - 1992 is Bianca Flaux with merlot.\n    - 1996 is Vendemmia with riesling.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clue 4, we know that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.\n   We need to figure out which one fits the clues better.\n\n4. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.\n   From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.\n   Therefore, the order of bottling is: Ece Suss < Bianca Flaux < Vendemmia.\n   This means:\n   - Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984.\n   - Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n\n5. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.\n   - Ece Suss cannot be in 1984.\n   - Annata Branco cannot be in 1988 since Ece Suss cannot be in 1984.\n\n   Considering the above restrictions:\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n   ```\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer\n1988 | Ece Suss      | pinot noir\n1992 | Bianca Flaux  | merlot\n1996 | Vendemmia     | riesling\n```",

From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia, so Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1996, and Vendemmia cannot be in 1984 or 1988.\n   \n5. From clue 5, Bianca Flaux is after Ece Suss, so Bianca Flaux cannot be in 1984, and Ece Suss cannot be in 1996.\n   \n6. From clue 1, Ece Suss is after Annata Branco, so Annata Branco cannot be in 1988.\n\n   Let\u2019s piece together the possibilities:\n\n   ```\n   1984 | Annata Branco          | gewurztraminer\n   1988 | Ece Suss               | pinot noir\n   1992 | Bianca Flaux           | merlot\n   1996 | Vendemmia              | riesling\n   ```\n\n7.
